#Im getting MEAN

Today, I started updating my blog on ajinkyaxjs.com, previously I used to maintain ajwebdesigner.in

My all time favorite NodeJs, how can I stop myself from writing about it. Finally I could say I can create my own REST api using MEAN stack. I will be updating this post with my github source code soon.
Below plugins I'm using to create my first ever MEAN project.

  - Express
  - Mongoose
  - Morgan, body-parser
  - AngularJs

My aim here is create CRUD app for now, and upgrade it with some neat PassportJs authentication in coming days. Oh, did I tell you I just finished assembling my Raspberry Pi.
