Since 1996, JavaScript: The Definitive Guide has been the bible for JavaScript programmersâ€”a programmer's guide and comprehensive reference to the core language and to the client-side JavaScript APIs defined by web browsers.

Everything is perfect about this book, except for some uncertain things not described like Client-side JavaScript does not exhibit the nonlinear cross-reference problem and it was mentioned that it's recommended to read book from start to end but some chapters are too easy to understand and some are too hard. Overall this book is great, recommended for beginners.

The 6th edition covers HTML5 and ECMAScript 5. Many chapters have been completely rewritten to bring them in line with today's best web development practices. New chapters in this edition document jQuery and server side JavaScript. It's recommended for experienced programmers who want to learn the programming language of the Web, and for current JavaScript programmers who want to master it.


My rating 4 on 5 stars.

What Professionals are saying:

  - "I made a career of what I learned from JavaScript: The Definitive Guide." -Andrew Hedges, Tapulous
  
  - "A must-have reference for expert JavaScript programmers...well-organized and detailed." -Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript, CTO of Mozilla
  
So, if you are seriouse about getting into JavaScript, <a href="http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/javascript-definitive-guide-english-6th/p/itmdx922zhvghx2g?pid=9789350233948&affid=bestflipk">Buy JavaScript: The Definitive Guide </a>
And well if you are like me, who dont like big fat books, <a href="http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/javascript-good-parts-english/p/itmdun3fjqdh9ndk?pid=9780596517748&affid=bestflipk">Buy JavaScript : The Good Parts </a>. But its recommended to learn basics first beforing buying JS the Good Parts book.
